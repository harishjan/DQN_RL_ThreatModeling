**This is just a simulation***
This is an attempt to simulate cybersecurity threat modelling using reinforcement learning.
This code integrates Deep Q-Network (DQN) to dynamically allocate cybersecurity resources, enabling continuous adaptation to emerging threats.
The custom created dataset consisting of real-world threat actions and cybersecurity capabilities, facilitating the modelling of adversarial behaviors and the evaluation of defense mechanisms based on MITRE ATT&CK Framework.
Model only simulates DQN model learns to allocate resources efficiently which could imprveoverall defense of the system in a dynamic environment.
